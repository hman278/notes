title: Sargis' notes
draft: false

I am Sargis (pronounced /ˈsɑːr-ɡɪs/). I will be using my digital garden to write about my thoughts and findings about computers and other subjects I find interesting enough to study. I like keeping things simple and applying critical analysis to my newly gained knowledge, so you may see me sharing my perspective on things a lot on here!

Currently, I am studying very hard to obtain a Computer Science Bachelors degree from UoPeople. At the time of writing this, I am a quarter way done with my degree and am very happy that I never gave up on my studies. I find immense joy in learning about the world and growing as a person, although I find that I sacrifice a lot to gain a better perspective on this world.

Graphics programming is most likely the thing I want to learn the most about, and find it is going to be particularly challenging and time-consuming, which I am all for. Hopefully, at some point, I will start sharing my work and findings regarding that, but in the meantime, hope you find something interesting to read or learn about here.
